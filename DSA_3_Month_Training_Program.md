2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Input constraints, edge cases
3. **Think out loud** - Explain your approach
4. **Start simple** - Brute force first, then optimize
5. **Test your code** - Walk through with examples
6. **Discuss trade-offs** - Time vs space complexity

### Problem-Solving Framework:
1. **Understand** (5 mins): Clarify requirements and constraints
2. **Plan** (10 mins): Choose approach and discuss complexity
3. **Code** (20 mins): Implement clean, working solution
4. **Test** (10 mins): Verify with examples and edge cases

## üìà Advanced Tips for Success

### Time Management:
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused sessions
- **Daily Consistency**: Better than weekend marathons
- **Quality over Quantity**: Understand solutions deeply

### Problem-Solving Mindset:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Always ask "What pattern does this follow?"
- **Multiple Solutions**: Explore brute force ‚Üí optimized approaches
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, single elements, maximum constraints

### Communication Skills:
- **Explain your thinking**: Interviewers want to see your process
- **Ask for hints**: If stuck, ask for guidance rather than staying silent
- **Stay calm**: Practice under time pressure regularly

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **Jumping to code** without understanding the problem
2. **Not considering edge cases** in your solution
3. **Poor variable naming** and code organization
4. **Not discussing time/space complexity**
5. **Getting frustrated** when stuck
